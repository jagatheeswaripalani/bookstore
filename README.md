Bookstore Microservices Project
📖 Overview
This project is a beginner-friendly implementation of a microservices architecture using Python and Flask. It simulates a Bookstore Inventory System with two microservices:

Book Service: Manages the list of books in the store.
Order Service: Handles placing and viewing book orders.
Both services communicate via REST APIs to perform their operations.

🎯 Features
Add, view, and search for books in the inventory.
Place an order for a book.
View all placed orders.
RESTful APIs for communication between microservices.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
Flask: Lightweight web framework for building APIs.
Requests: HTTP library for microservice communication.

🌐 Future Enhancements
Use Docker to containerize the microservices.
Integrate a database (e.g., SQLite, MongoDB) for persistent storage.
Deploy the services to the cloud (AWS, Heroku, or Google Cloud).
Add a frontend to interact with the services via a web interface.
Use a message queue (RabbitMQ/Kafka) for asynchronous communication.
